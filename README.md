# Driftless - Push Back

The code behind the **Driftless** VexU team, from UW Platteville.

Written by Matthew Backman, original project formatting based on [Nathan Sandvig's Over Under library](https://github.com/Ender717/WISCO_OverUnder).

The intent of having this repository public is to be able to showcase our work, not to give out. If you wish to use anything from this repository, I strongly suggest taking the time to learn and understand the meaning, rather than straight copying.
